Objectives: 1) To confirm reports of associations between ADHD symptoms and DLPFC structure and function. 2) To determine if these associations are explained by the expression in the DLPFC of ADHD risk genes. We plan to access the clinical assessments; cognitive data; neuroimaging and genotype data. We will derive neural phenotypes from MPRAGE, DTI, and resting state, and will use gene transcriptomic imputation methods to predict expression in the DLPFC. Linear regression will test for associations between ADHD symptoms and the DLPFC neural phenotypes, including as covariates, age, sex, cognitive variables (eg IQ) and 10 PCs to correct for population stratification. For objective 2, we will test if imputed DLPFC gene expression mediates the association between ADHD symptoms and DLPFC phenotypes. Our methods do not increase any chances of de-identification, and analyses on the ABCD cohort will be conducted at intramural NHGRI using the Biowulf supercomputing system.
