I started playing with the list of binary SX (clinics_binary_sx_baseline.xlsx). Using the DICA and NV_interview
sheets (also, simplex versions), I couldn't find binary SX for 2 out of the 380
in their baseline date. Then, there was 3 with missing interview, only SX, so
they had to be removed.

I'm waiting to hear from Wendy on 7620214, and I had to correct SX for 4848779
because it was wrong (inverted) in Philip's sheet... DICA is correct based on
binary SX.
