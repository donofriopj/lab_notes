These are from last chat with Philip:

- [ ] Do the within ADHD analysis, using remission and persistent labels. But also in a separate analysis use ADHD_NOS (anyone with 3, 4, or 5 SX), and group them into improvers and nonimprovers (persistent and remission doesn't apply to NOS). Of course, using slopes would work for both analysis.
- [ ] Try redoing the analysis by ignoring the people that get worse. They could be a group on their own. Should we even include them?
- [ ] Try re-balancing the classes in the CV to see if the results are any different.
- [ ] Plot results in the brain just to see if they make sense.
- [x] Push the univariate analysis even further using FDR.
- [x] Use SNPs from PGC when selecting within our sample, instead of univariate, otherwise it would be a mini-GWAS that people won't like.

From WIP idle mind:

- [x] GO ahead with cognitive data that JEn prepaered
- [ ] Try to get results with a test group in case Wendy's calling project
  doesn't yield too many people 
- [ ] Do basic univariate analysis for comparison
- [ ] Start using rsfMRI data Jen and Esteban finished processing

From quick chat with Philip today:

- [ ] Run everything on ever had ADHD vs NV, because genes should show something
  these, and also in SX at assessment
- [ ] Run genome-wide significance for SNPs, just to show it, even though nothing
  will come out of it
- [ ] Run dummy classifiers to assess significance (i.e. not show only the best ones)
- [ ] Use new DTI motion parameters to assess if we're using correct IDs.
- [ ] Try best uni models getting features from training set! (not necessarily
  bad if using replication set from Wendy, but definitely needed otherwise)
