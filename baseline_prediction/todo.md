These are from last chat with Philip:

- [ ] Do the within ADHD analysis, using remission and persistent labels. But also in a separate analysis use ADHD_NOS (anyone with 3, 4, or 5 SX), and group them into improvers and nonimprovers (persistent and remission doesn't apply to NOS). Of course, using slopes would work for both analysis.
- [ ] Try redoing the analysis by ignoring the people that get worse. They could be a group on their own. Should we even include them?
- [ ] Try re-balancing the classes in the CV to see if the results are any different.
- [ ] Plot results in the brain just to see if they make sense.
- [ ] Push the univariate analysis even further using FDR.
- [ ] Use SNPs from PGC when selecting within our sample, instead of univariate, otherwise it would be a mini-GWAS that people won't like.

From WIP idle mind:

- [ ] GO ahead with cognitive data that JEn prepaered
- [ ] Try to get results with a test group in case Wendy's calling project
  doesn't yield too many people 
- [ ] Do basic univariate analysis for comparison
- [ ] Start using rsfMRI data Jen and Esteban finished processing
