The idea here is to derive network metrics form the fMRI data. We could use one of the two parcellations, and then we have the trimmed and non-trimmed data. The othe rotpions we have are adding binary edges only for significantly connected ROIs, and using weighted edges. Finally, we have the option of using correlation or partial correlation. In fact, that could be a decision for the other correlation work too... pcorr or full corr?
